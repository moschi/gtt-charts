# gtt-charts

gtt-charts is a cli application written in .NET 5 which allows the automatic creation of graphs, optionally included in a markdown file, of time tracking in gitlab. It uses the Gitlab API to get information about issues and time tracking entries. Parsing logic was adapted from [kriskbx/gitlab-time-tracker: ðŸ¦ŠðŸ•˜ A command line interface for GitLab's time tracking feature. (github.com)](https://github.com/kriskbx/gitlab-time-tracker).

The charts are generated with the awesome [ScottPlot/ScottPlot: Interactive Plotting Library for .NET (github.com)](https://github.com/ScottPlot/ScottPlot) library.

A complete example for a resulting markdown file can be found [here](./example/Timereport.md).



## Disclaimer / Acknowledgements

I cannot guarantee that this software will work in your situation, and I cannot guarantee that the reports generated are free of errors. Please do review the charts critically and compare the numbers with the insights possible in GitLab.
