# gtt-charts

gtt-charts is a small cli application written in .NET 5 which allows the automatic creation of graphs, optionally included in a markdown file, of time tracking in gitlab.

It builds on [GitHub - kriskbx/gitlab-time-tracker: ðŸ¦ŠðŸ•˜ A command line interface for GitLab's time tracking feature.](https://github.com/kriskbx/gitlab-time-tracker) for getting the time tracking data from gitlab and the scripts provided in [Samuel / GitLabTimeTrackingTutorial Â· GitLab (hsr.ch)](https://gitlab.dev.ifs.hsr.ch/murthy10/GitLabTimeTrackingTutorial). Said scripts were altered slightly to include Labels and Milestones in the issue table.

The exported SQLite database is then loaded by gtt-charts and processed into a number of charts which are listed further down.



## Requirements

- .NET 5 for gtt-charts
- Python 3 for running the scripts to create the SQLite DB
- Node.JS for running gitlab-time-tracker
